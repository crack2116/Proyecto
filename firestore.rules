/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Transport App
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model with user-specific
 * ownership where applicable.  Admins have full access.  Users have access to
 * their own profiles and the service requests that they created.  Data
 * validation is relaxed to allow for rapid prototyping and iteration.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only by the user and admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin role; document existence grants admin privileges.
 * - /clients/{clientId}: Stores client information, accessible by admins.
 * - /drivers/{driverId}: Stores driver information, accessible by admins.
 * - /vehicles/{vehicleId}: Stores vehicle information, accessible by admins.
 * - /serviceRequests/{serviceRequestId}: Stores transport service requests, accessible by admins and the client who created it.
 * - /routes/{routeId}: Stores route information, accessible by admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed.
 * - Admin role is determined by the existence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}.
 * - Data validation is minimal, focusing on authorization and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * To simplify rules and improve performance, the following denormalization strategy is used:
 * - The `serviceRequests` collection needs `clientId` in order to implement security rules.
